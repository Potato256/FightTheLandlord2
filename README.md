#  FightTheLandlord2 AI

This project is an artificial intelligence system designed for the card game FightTheLandlord2. The AI runs on the Botzone platform, and you can find more information about the game [here](https://wiki.botzone.org.cn/index.php?title=FightTheLandlord2) and play it on [Botzone](https://www.botzone.org.cn/game/FightTheLandlord2).

## Introduction

This project is an AI implementation for the card game FightTheLandlord2. I collaborated with my roommates during my freshman year to develop this AI. FightTheLandlord2 is a complex and strategic card game, and the AI aims to provide a challenging opponent for players on the Botzone platform.

## Features

- **MCTS Algorithm**: The AI leverages the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, enabling it to make informed decisions and play strategically in the game.
- **Robustness**: With over 6000 lines of code (LOC), the AI is designed to handle the complexity of the game and make intelligent moves, making it a powerful opponent for players.
- **Botzone Compatibility**: The AI is compatible with the Botzone platform, allowing users to test and play against it in the FightTheLandlord2 game environment.
